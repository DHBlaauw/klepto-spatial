# Workflow

## Reading literature

It's important to know what you're dealing with, and reading previous findings is a good place to begin. Take a week to read the literature.

A literature collection is being assembled in a Zotero group library: **[https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499059/course-2020-comm-ecol](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499059/course-2020-comm-ecol)**. You'll need to register on Zotero and request access. Contact us if this gets confusing.

Zotero **[link: https://www.zotero.org/](https://www.zotero.org/)** is a reference management program for the storage and citation of academic papers. Download Zotero, the connector for your browser, and optionally the plugin for your word processor. Create an account and sync the group library for access to the references and pdfs.

### How to approach the literature list

1. Begin by reading papers that give a broad overview of the fields of spatial ecology [@levin1992], animal movement [@nathan2008] and the links between movement and large-scale processes such as community assembly [@jeltsch2013; @schlagel2020]. 

    Consider a specific example from a simulation study of how individual movement behaviour can lead to large scale patterns in the spread of rabies [@jeltsch1997].

2. Move on to reading about the evolution of individual behavioural strategies [@wolf2010; @wolf2012], and the consequences of variation in strategies for ecology and evolution [@wolf2012a]. 

    Read about the North American bluebird system  in @duckworth2007 as an illustration of these concepts.

3. The data you'll analyse comes from _Kleptomove_, a spatially explicit individual based simulation model (IBM); read what IBMs are and why they were developed [@huston1988; @deangelis2005].

    Return to this document to read more about _Kleptomove_ in the section below.

    Continue to explore how IBMs are used to study processes at both the landscape scale [such as spatial patterning; @grimm2005] and the individual level [such as animal movement; @deangelis2019].

4. In _Kleptomove_ the strategy of stealing food from other individuals, or kleptoparasitism, abruptly takes over the population until a large proportion of individuals attempt to steal from others. 

    Such abrupt shifts in a system are called _critical transitions_ [@scheffer2001], and the state of a system at which these shifts occur is called a _tipping point_[@vannes2016].

    Critical transitions occur in many different systems: from landscapes [@hirota2011] to animal groups [@tunstrom2013]. Read these papers about critical transitions to understand more.

5. Critical transitions are often referred to as 'catastrophic', and there is wide ranging interest in detecting them before they happen. The spatial characteristics of landscapes can hold clues to impending critical transitions. 

    Read @guttal2009 and @dakos2010 to see how spatial correlation (how similar are two points on the landscape) can indicate a critical transition.

5. You'll be doing spatial autocorrelation analysis at two scales: global, i.e., referring to the full extent of the Kleptomove landscape, and local, i.e., relating to smaller areas within the landscape. 

    Read about global spatial autocorrelation [@sokal1978; @sokal1978a], and then local spatial autocorrelation [@sokal1998; @sokal1998a]. Read [@anselin1995] to look at a specific measure of local spatial autocorrelation called _Moran I local_.
